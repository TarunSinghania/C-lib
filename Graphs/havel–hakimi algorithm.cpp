#degree sequence

#nesseacry but not sufficient condotions for grpah to exist for 
#sum of degree sum must be even
#max degree < max vertices - 1

#one degree squence can have multiple grpahs  

#take degree sequence 2 1 1 
#then if you connect 1 and 1 we will have nothing for 2.
#hence always take out larger and clear it first


#same havel hakimi
#sort non decreasing and then take lead vertice and add edges to other vertices 
#repeat till you can 
#if got negative stop
