Some Terminology:

T is called the text string and P₁, ..., Pₖ are
called pattern strings

Let m = |T|, the length of the string to be
searched.
● Let n = |P₁| + |P₂| + ... + |Pₖ| be the total
length of all the pattern strings.
● Let Lmax be the length of the longest pattern
string.
● Assume that strings are drawn from an
alphabet Σ, where |Σ| is some constant.


Problem : search for all occurences of all patterns in the text

BF : For each position in T:
		For each pattern string Pᵢ:
			Check if Pᵢ appears at that position.

Trie searching: O(n) (pre-processing trie making)  + O(mLmax)



Suffix Links
● A suffix link (sometimes called a failure link) is
a red edge from a trie node corresponding to
string α to the trie node corresponding to a string
ω such that ω is the longest proper suffix of α that
is still in the trie.
● Intuition: When we hit a part of the string where
we cannot continue to read characters, we fall
back by following suffix links to try to preserve as
much context as possible.
● Every node in the trie, except the root (which
corresponds to the empty string ε), will have a
suffix link associated with it.

Issues with only suffix links:

● Our heavily optimized string searcher no
longer starts searching from each
position in the string.
● As a result, we now might forget to
output matches in certain cases

Adding outpur link : 

this blue arrow is called an output
link. Whenever we visit this a node,
we'll output the string represented by
the node at the end of the blue arrow till blue arrow ends



To account for this, let z denote the number of matches
reported by our algorithm.
● The runtime of the match phase is then Θ(m + z), with the
m term coming from the string scanning and the z term
coming from the matches.
● You sometimes hear algorithms whose runtime depends on how
much output is generated referred to as output-sensitive
algorithms.
